## 🧩 Who Am I

I am a developer and creator captivated by the beauty of **language, music, and interaction**.

You can call me **Real_KyoShinn** or **Chen Yu**—  
two avatars in my digital world, and characters from stories still unfolding.

On this side of the screen, I live two lives:

- 💻 **By day**: Turning imagination into interfaces, one line of code at a time.
- 🌙 **By night**: Trading keyboards for pens and microphones, letting words and melodies carry my dreams forward.

## 🎨 What I Love

- 🎵 **Telling Stories with Sound**: Cover songs, improvisational singing, turning emotions into replayable moments.
- ✍️ **Bridging with Words**: Every sentence written is a letter to the future, hoping to exchange a knowing glance with you.
- 🎮 **Seeing the World Through Games**: Each "Start Game" is a brief journey, practicing becoming braver under someone else's rules.
- 🔐 **Language as Keys**: Learning a new language feels like opening a window, letting the distant breeze blow in.

## ⚡ A Small Easter Egg

> “Meeting is already a miracle, how coincidental that we both looked back at that moment.”  
> Since fate has paused, why not save this moment as a **friend request**?

✨ This homepage is made up of coffee, code, and unfinished songs.
