## 🧩 Who Am I

Hi, I'm RealMaybe, a **developer** and **creator** fascinated by the beauty of language, music, and interaction.

You can call me **_Kyo Shinn_** or **_Chen Yu_** — names that belong as much to the Original Characters I created as to my digital presence.

Beyond code, I also explore more possibilities of stories and emotions as a **fiction writer**, **musician**, and **game enthusiast**.

-   💻 **By day**: Weaving imagination into reality through code.
-   🌙 **By night**: Trading keyboards for pens and microphones, letting words and melodies carry my dreams forward.

---

## 🎨 What I Love

-   🎵 **Telling Stories with Sound**: Cover songs, improvisational singing, turning emotions into replayable moments.
-   ✍️ **Building Bridges with Words**: Every sentence I write is a letter to the future, hoping to connect with a kindred spirit.
-   🎮 **Seeing the World Through Games**: Each "Start Game" is a brief journey, learning to be braver within someone else's rules.
-   🔐 **Language as Keys**: Learning a new language feels like opening a window, letting the distant breeze blow in.

## ⚡ A Small Easter Egg

> Our meeting is a miracle in itself— what a coincidence that we turned to look at each other in the very same instant.
> Since fate has paused, why not save this moment as a connection?

✨ This homepage is made up of coffee, code, and unfinished songs.
